"""
List comprehensions are one cool and unique feature of Python.
They essentially act as a terse and concise way of initializing
and populating a list given some expression that specifies how
the list should be populated. 

Take a look at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
for more info regarding list comprehensions.
